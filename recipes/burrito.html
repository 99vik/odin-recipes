    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb. lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning mix</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups refried beans (or 1 ½ cups drained and rinsed black beans)</li>
        <li>¾ cup corn kernels</li>
        <li>3 cups cooked rice </li>
        <li>6 large (10-inch) flour tortillas</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 350° F. Spray 9 x 13-inch baking dish with cooking spray and set aside</li>
        <li>
            Cook beef with taco seasoning mix, according to seasoning package instructions.
        </li>
        <li>
            To prepare 1 burrito: spread ¼ cup beans down center of tortillas; top with ½ cup rice, beef, 2 tablespoons corn, and ¼ cup cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fold in opposite sides of each tortilla, then roll up, burrito style. Place, seam-sides down, in prepared dish. Repeat with remaining ingredients to prepare 6 total burritos.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cover with foil and bake for 25 minutes (until heated through). If you are baking the burritos from the refrigerator while they’re still cold, it will take about 30-35 minutes for them to heat through.
